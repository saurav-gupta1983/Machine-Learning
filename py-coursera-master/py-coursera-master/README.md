===========

Python framework for Coursera [PGM](https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm) and
[ML](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) homeworks

The Coursera PGM and ML classes use [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) 
for their homework assignments.Arguably Octave is great for novice students
getting started quickly with a single package that allows them to quickly
manipulate matrices etc.  However many students in the PGM and ML courses
have wondered if there couldn't be a Python alternative based on
[SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) or other similar frameworks for Python.

While it may not be possible to create a perfect replacement for Octave many
more programming experienced students would love to be working with Python
rather than Octave, particularly because of support for testing, continuous
integration and so forth.

This repository is a placeholder for any and all attempts to replicate parts of
the Coursera PGM and ML homework assignment code in Python.  It was created as
part of [this discussion][OrigDisc]
in the PGM class, which annoyingly you will be unable to access if you didn't
sign up for PGM first time around, so please email
[py-coursera@googlegroups.com](mailto:py-coursera@googlegroups.com) for a summary 
if you're interested.  By the time you read this there may a good summary in the archives:

In the first instance we'll attempt to recreate the ML/PGM Octave tutorials
using the Enthought SciPy/Python distribution.  Here's the start of a
transcript based on Prof Ng's [Octave transcript][OctaveTrans]

[ipython session](https://github.com/tansaku/py-coursera/blob/master/ipython_session.py)

Let me elaborate, [IPython](http://ipython.org) is Python with a high powered interactive shell:

which we've pulled in as part of the one click install [Enthought distribution.](http://www.enthought.com),

This [ipython_session][IPSession] thing now mostly complete due to some great work by 
[Jeff Tratner](https://github.com/jtratner).

The rest (PGM and ML assignments + infrastructure) is TODO - We'll keep working on it, but all help appreciated it.
Please let us know your github id if you'd like to collaborate. Feel free to
email [sjoseph@hpu.edu](mailto:sjoseph@hpu.edu).
