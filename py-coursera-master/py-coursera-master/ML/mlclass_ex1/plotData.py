  # ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
  # Instructions: Plot the training data into a figure using the 
  #               "figure" and "plot" commands. Set the axes labels using
  #               the "xlabel" and "ylabel" commands. Assume the 
  #               population and revenue data have been passed in
  #               as the x and y arguments of this function.
  #
  # Hint: You can use the 'rx' option with plot to have the markers
  #       appear as red crosses. Furthermore, you can make the
  #       markers larger by using plot(..., 'rx', markersize=10);
